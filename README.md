# amica
The project dedicated to searching for amicable numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicable_numbers).

As task is complex from computational point, and it uses prime numbers, on the first step we'll create utility for searching prime numbers up to 2^64-1 (which in turn uses results of utility searching prime numbers up to 2^32-1).
